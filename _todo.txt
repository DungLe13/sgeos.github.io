Relay conventions.
mobile team and backend team would work together to figure out what documents were needed
mobile team built a fake service that would provide that data so they could iterate locally
backend team made a test case with an example doc and wrote code till it worked
then hooked them together and they almost always "Just Worked" with very little extra effort
I will say if you _are_ planning on using Relay at any point you may want to investigate certain
conventions they use on top of regular graphql so that both your mobile and front end apis use
the same conventions

Go as a Service on FreeBSD
First of all, I want to say that developing a daemon service in go on FreeBSD is the most
convenient setup I have ever used.  I have been excited by many things.  Some of the solutions
I have looked into were not rejected because the framework was inherently bad, but because
installation was non trivial and did not succeed in a timely fashion.  Go is easy to install
and work with on FreeBSD.  This howto assumes no knowledge of go, handbook level knowledge of
FreeBSD and root privileges.
