Orbital parameters.

- $x$ = semimajor axis.
- $x$ = eccentricity.
- $x$ = inclination.
- $x$ = argument of periapsis.
- $x$ = periapsis passage.
- $x$ = longitude of ascending node.

Inverse square law.  Energy received is $\frac{1}{r^2}$, where $r$ is the
distance from the source of the electromagnetic radiation.  Specifically,
energy is radiated in a sphere.  A sphere has a surface area of $4\pi r^2$.
(See [NASA Basics of Space Flight, Section 1, Chapter 6. Electromagnetic Phenomena](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/bsf6-1.php)).

Thrust of a pumped liquid bipropellant rocket.  (See [NASA Basics of Space Flight, Section 1, Chapter 3. Gravitation and Mechanics CONTINUED](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/bsf3-2.php).)

$$
\begin{align}
& \text{Thrust} = F = \dot{m}V_e+(p_e-p_o)A_e \\
\end{align}
$$

- $\dot{m}$ = Mass flow rate.
- $V_e$ = Exit velocity.
- $p_e$ = Exit pressure.
- $p_o$ = Outside pressure.
- $A_e$ = Nozzle exit area.

Relationship of wavelength to frequency.
(See [NASA Basics of Space Flight, Section 1, Chapter 6. Electromagnetic Phenomena CONTINUES](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/bsf6-2.php)).

$$
\begin{align}
& \lambda = \frac{c}{f} \\
& f = \frac{c}{\lambda} \\
\end{align}
$$

- $\lambda$ = Wavelength.
- $f$ = Frequency.
- $c$ = Speed of light.
